    Functionality:
        Finding an adequate (optimal or near optimal) number of iterations suitable for a given SAT problem when `k` is unknown.
        The method being used is described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9605034.pdf (section 4).

            # We could have halt after finding one solution.
            # Using the iterative method we can build a circuit that amplifies all solutions - in excahnge for computational cost.

            # If we can't find `precision` good answers - we reduce `precision` and iterate over the process again.
            # `precision` can be thought as the degree of accuracy - for large values of `precision` more optimal results will be obtained.
    Parameters:
        n (int) - amount of input qubits.
